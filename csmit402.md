A clone of a repository is a copy of its entirety. If you change your clone it just changes the clone, and not the original. It is like passing a parameter by value, not by reference.

A fork is also a copy of the original repository but its purpose is for the changes made to the original repository will be turned into their own new version.

A branch is similar to a fork in that it creates its own new repository, but the intention is to push the changes back to the original, not to a new version entirely.
