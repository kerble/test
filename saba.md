Git fork creates a copy of an entire repository and saves it to your GitHub account. You 
can merge the forked by first submitting a pull request that must be verified by the owner. 
Git clone also creates a copy of a repository, but it is instead saved to a local directory. 
Changes made here can be merged with "git push" assuming you have write privileges.
Otherwise you must use a forked repository. Git branch allows you to work on code away from 
main and merge afterwards. The repository is not copied. This means there will always be a 
working version on main, and you can work on multiple features simultaneously by yourself or others.
